to run all the test we use comand called py.test it will run all the tests and also we use -v -s commonds also to run specific file we need to give method name

 to  run specific modules we will use this methods py.test k specific name -v -s

-k stands for methods name execution

-s stands  for logs

-v stands for more info

if we want run smoke or any other test cases we need to use

@pytest.mark.smoke --- customized

in the command line we need to use py.text -m -s -v  in this only we will get passesd failed and selected un selected in the logs

to skip the test we use this method  @pytest.mark.skip ---predefined

pytest.xfail it will run the test but in the report it wont give scuess or failure response
